I will be posting forecast models that I created to forecast some U.S. Macroeconomic Indicators. Models are using Deep Learning Techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). I will also compare the out of sample forecasting accuracy of these complex models to benchmark models (Random Walk and Moving Average Models). 

# LSTM.py 
This file has Recurrent Neural Network (Long short-term memory) model for Cost of Fossil-Fuel Receipts at Electric Generatic Plants. 
Data source: 
https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/?tbl=T09.09#/?f=M

You can also use the attached MER_T09_09.csv file as data source. 
Update the working directory in pd.read_csv() function, then code should run. 

Thanks
