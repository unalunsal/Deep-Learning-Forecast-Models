I will be posting forecast models that I created to forecast some U.S. Macroeconomic Indicators. Models are using Deep Learning Techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). I will also compare the out of sample forecasting accuracy of these complex models to benchmark models (Random Walk and Moving Average Models). 
Thanks
